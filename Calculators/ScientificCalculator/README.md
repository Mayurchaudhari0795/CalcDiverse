# Scientific Calculator

## Description
This project is a **Scientific Calculator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It extends the basic calculator's functionality by incorporating advanced mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, square root, exponentiation, and constants like π and e.

The calculator is designed to handle basic arithmetic as well as more complex mathematical calculations typically used in science and engineering.

## Features
- Basic Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Percentage Calculation
- Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Logarithmic Function (log)
- Exponentiation (^)
- Square Root (√)
- Constants (π and e)
- Clear and Delete (C and DEL)

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator layout and UI elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling all the mathematical logic and interactive features of the calculator.
